E4302 Methods in Computational Science Term Project 

Implementation of finite volume methods for conservation law on GPU

Note: 
1. Try rho solver nonlinear euler equation
2. Separate the flux calculation and solution update 
   (Is it suitable for case in GPU?)
3. Timing data can be found in pyclaw paper!
